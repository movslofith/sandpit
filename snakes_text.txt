There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they’re found 
everywhere except in Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. 
About 600 species are venomous, and only about 200—seven percent—are able to 
kill or significantly wound a human.

Nonvenomous snakes, which range from harmless garter snakes to the not-so-harmless
python, dispatch their victims by swallowing them alive or constricting them 
to death. Whether they kill by striking with venom or squeezing, nearly all snakes 
eat their food whole, in sometimes astoundingly large portions.

Almost all snakes are covered in scales and as reptiles, they’re cold blooded 
and must regulate their body temperature externally. Scales serve several purposes: 
They trap moisture in arid climates and reduce friction as the snake moves. There 
have been several species of snakes discovered that are mostly scaleless, but even 
those have scales on their bellies.

How snakes hunt

Snakes also have forked tongues, which they flick in different directions to smell 
their surroundings. That lets them know when danger—or food—is nearby.

Snakes have several other ways to detect a snack. Openings called pit holes in front 
of their eyes sense the heat given off by warm-blooded prey. And bones in their lower 
jaws pick up vibrations from rodents and other scurrying animals. When they do 
capture prey, snakes can eat animals up to three times bigger than their head is wide 
because their lower jaws unhinge from their upper jaws. Once in a snake’s mouth, the 
prey is held in place by teeth that face inward, trapping it there.
